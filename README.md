# Supermarket-Facility-Location-Optimisation using real-valued metaheuristic.

The **facility location** problem is about finding the best locations for some facilities. With a list of cities, some supermarkets are to be build in them. The supermarkets can be in or out of the cities. Population is assumed to be living in the cities only. We are looking to minimise the total travel time for all customers. Data was used in the form of two files with `supermarket_cities_locations.csv` having coordinates of cities and `supermarket_cities_populations.csv` having corresponding populations. Approaches used are Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimisation and Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) in an experimental way.
